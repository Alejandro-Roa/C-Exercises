# C-Exercises
Solving basic programming problems with C language. 


C1 -Find all divisors of a number using repetition structures. -Given x different numbers, count how many of them are even. -Print the broken down operation and the result of the product of two numbers based on their sum.

C2 -Given a model type, card length and width, print the resulting border. The length and width will correspond to the number of horizontal and vertical characters respectively. -Make a program that helps you find the first N prime numbers.

C3 -Given a string, check if it is a palindrome or not. -Rewrite backwards (vowels-consonants) given a string; in case the phrase contains punctuation marks, "Ã±" or accent marks; these will be ignored.

C4 -Given an array of x positions, where each position has a different letter, arranged in a random order; sort the list so that the letters are in descending order. -Find the palindromic primes that appear within a given range, not including the limits.

C5 -Rotate a matrix 90 degrees. -Create a matrix containing the vowels and one containing the consonants.
